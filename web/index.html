					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						Clue (known as Cluedo outside of North America) is a video game based on the board game of the same name. Its formal name is Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion or Cluedo: Murder at Blackwell Grange (depending of whether the country uses American or British English).[1][2][3] It runs on Microsoft Windows. It was developed in 1998 for Hasbro Interactive by EAI. Infogrames (now Atari) took over publishing rights for the game in 2000 when Hasbro Interactive went out of business. The game, just like the board game, is "meant for 3-6 participants".[4] This is because there are only 6 suspects, and with two people there is very little gameplay available.

							For the clue lover, this game can be a little disappointing. I thought it was going to be the original clue board game where u can play against the comp or a friend... But it's not! It's is 1 person an only has 10 crimes to solve... Not a great deal considering it's price!! This is not a board game!!

							As the other reviewers said, this is not the original Clue boardgame (which is fine for me -- never liked that game format much anyway). It uses the setting and characters, but plays more like a classical logic game. In short, one wanders around Mr. Boddy's house interviewing people, who give statements of fact and point to objects to search,

							I was expecting the board game and I got something that only takes a minute to play. This was a waste of money! Do NOT buy this!

							This would work well in an abstract logic game, where it is easy to assume that the given facts of a problem are always true. However, it requires quite a lot of suspension-of-disbelief to do this for a detective game, when all the suspects involved are slick, intelligent, deceitful people. Suspects will even, on occasion, give themselves away quite bluntly (and hilariously). Scarlet, for example, once informed me that the murderer was a woman, when there was only one woman in that particular assignment: herself. Perhaps for future versions, it might be more fun to have a more advanced ruleset.
